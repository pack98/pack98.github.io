# Turning in Popcorn Orders
I'll be honest, we've never been super duper fast in processing orders on Popcorn Order turn in night. However, each year we get a little better and this year we've implemented a few changes we think will help everyone out.

Most importantly, your money collected must match your order form total + donations. 

## Please Verify:
* order by order (row) totals
* column (quantity) totals
* total amount
* money collected equals your total amount
* your Scout's prize choices
* if you have Donations, please note their total to the side of the order totals

## Turn-in Times
We are staggering the time that you can arrive and turn in your form. Starting at 6:00 pm, we will be here to collect Order Forms and Money.
