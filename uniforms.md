# All About Cub Scout Uniforms
First off, **no uniform is required for any Cub Scout activity.**

There are 2 types of Cub Scout Uniforms:

- **The Class A uniform is the traditional, formal Cub Scout Uniform with a blue shirt (or tan shirt for Webelos Scouts).** [Details about the uniform are described by rank, along with patch placement, at bsauniforms.org.](http://bsauniforms.org/)

- **The Class B uniform is a Scouting t-shirt.** We are fond of our Pack 98 t-shirts, but there are many designs available from the Scout Shop.

We encourage Scouts to wear a uniform because it makes Scouts feel like they are part of something bigger than themselves. However, a Cub Scout uniform isn't required to participate in any Cub Scout activity, because we know there are many good reasons why a Scout may not have one.

## Do I need to buy a complete Class A uniform?
Most of our Scouts have a Class A shirt and one or more Class B t-shirts. A few have the complete uniform.

Some buy the Cub Scout belt to hold the belt loops they earn along the way towards earning their rank. Alternatively, some families [make displays for their Scout's belt loops instead of wearing them on a belt.](https://www.pinterest.com/search/pins/?q=Cub%20Scout%20belt%20loop%20display)

## Where can we buy a uniform?
The easiest place to buy part or all of a Scout uniform is the Scout Shop in Little Rock at 3220 Cantrell Rd ([501-663-7157](tel:501-663-7157)) or online at [ScoutStuff.org](https://scoutstuff.org). I think a Scout shirt runs about $25 from either place.

You can also buy uniforms for a lower price in good, sometimes excellent condition from ebay.com, consignment shops or Rhea Lana.

## What is my Scouts Den Number for the Den Patch?
Given that a Den's size can change throughout the year resulting in division or contraction in the number of Dens for a given rank, and to avoid year over year Den patch churn, our guidance at this time is to either get the Den 1 patch or no Den patch at all.
