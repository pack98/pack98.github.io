> Will the following Scouts and their parents please come forward? **___**

> With so much symbolism built into the Arrow of Light patch, we thought it appropriate to take a few minutes to explain the symbolism so that we understand what it is the boys will be wearing on the chest, close to their heart. The prominent colors of the Arrow of Light are blue and gold The color blue represents the spirit of Cub Scouting. The color gold represents the warm rays of the sun. The arrow is symbolic of everything that is straight and true. Just as a Scout should be straight and true in his life and to himself. The arrow points the way of the Scouting trail. At the base of the arrow are three feathers. An arrow needs three feathers to fly straight and true. The three feathers represent the three groups which support and uphold the Scout: his den leaders, his parents, and his pack. The shaft of the arrow is long, straight and true, a reminder to the Scout to always be straight with, and true to, himself and that he must be honest with himself and others, and that this is sometimes a difficult and long journey. At the tip of the arrow is a sharp point, reminding the Scout that he must always remain sharp, alert and aware. The arch is the sun rising at daybreak, the start of a new week in scouting and in life. The arch in its entirety as a circle, represents the sun as the Scout is a source of light for those around him, and the full circle is a reminder that the spirit of Scouting is never ending. The seven rays represent the seven days of the week. A reminder that the Scout should do his best every day.
