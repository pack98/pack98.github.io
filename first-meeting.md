# Advice for Den Leaders
The Den Leader Guide is an excellent resource. It explains the Cub Scout program, your role as a Den Leader, the structure of Den Meetings, and suggested Den Meeting plans. Many of your questions are answered in great detail there.

However, the most important advice I can give you is this: you don't have to follow the Leader's Guide in order. I strongly suggest you do as many outdoor activities as possible during September and October while there is daylight during Den Meetings. Daylight Savings Time, usually the first weekend of November, marks the transition to it being dark during the entire meeting time.

For all meetings, remember to keep it simple, make it fun. Don't feel stressed if you don't cover everything you planned in a meeting. Just make sure the boys are involved, having fun, and and making some progress.

Encourage parents to be present and active in your Den Meetings. If they come, give them a job, however small, that keeps them present and involved.

Remember the Cub Scout Motto: "Do Your Best." It's not "Be Perfect." This applies to Scouts and Leaders. Keep this in mind as you judge a Scout's efforts toward their rank. If Scouts are doing their best and giving good effort, then things are going great.

# Tips for your First Den Meeting
- Have your Scouts develop their own code of conduct. If they are reluctant to talk, have them talk about the Golden Rule ("treat others the way you would like to be treated") and how that would apply to Cub Scouts.
- Play some kind of game where the boys introduce themselves. Older Scouts can form a circle and toss a ball to each other while saying their name or sharing their favorite things, etc.
- Have parents sign the Den Snacks sign-up sheet. Make sure they sign up for multiple meetings if you have more meetings scheduled than Scouts.
- Work on Bobcat requirements. All new Scouts have to earn their Bobcat rank before earning their yearly rank.
