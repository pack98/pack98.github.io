# Advice for Den Leaders
The Den Leader Guide is an excellent resource. It explains the Cub Scout program, your role as a Den Leader, the structure of Den Meetings, and suggested Den Meeting plans. Many of your questions are answered in great detail there.

**Please remember: you don't have to follow the Leader's Guide in order.** I strongly suggest you do as many outdoor activities as possible during September and October while there is daylight during Den Meetings. Daylight Savings Time, usually the first weekend of November, marks the transition to it being dark during the entire meeting time.

For all meetings, remember to **keep it simple, make it fun.** Don't feel stressed if you don't cover everything you planned in a meeting. If the boys are involved, having fun, and making progress, then you've had a fantastic meeting.

Encourage parents to be present and active in your Den Meetings. If they come, give them a job, however small, that keeps them present and involved.

**The Cub Scout Motto is: "Do Your Best", not "Be Perfect"** This applies to Cub Scouts and Leaders. Keep this in mind as you judge Scout's efforts toward their rank (and yourself as a Leader).

# Tips for your First Den Meeting
- Have your Scouts develop their own code of conduct. If they are reluctant to talk, have them talk about the Golden Rule ("treat others the way you would like to be treated") and how that would apply to Cub Scouts.
- Play some kind of game where the boys introduce themselves. Older Scouts can form a circle and toss a ball to each other while saying their name or sharing their favorite things, etc.
- Have parents sign the Den Snacks sign-up sheet. Make sure they sign up for multiple meetings if you have more meetings scheduled than Scouts.
- [Work on Bobcat requirements first.](bobcat.pdf) All new Scouts have to earn their Bobcat rank before earning their yearly rank. We want Scouts to earn their Bobcat rank soon after joining, so that they understand the basics and we can award them their first rank.
