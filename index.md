## Welcome to Pack 98
With the start of the new school year and so many new faces joining us, we've put together this site to answer the most common questions.

Our Pack Committee's decision making is guided by three principles:
1. When possible, do what is best for the boys.
2. Don't punish boys for the mistakes of adults.
3. Financial transparency in all our efforts.

### When do you meet?
Due to the surge in new Scouts joining us this year, this is the most confusing question. We do not have enough space at the building for all of us to meet at one time, so we have split into two nights:

**Returning Pack 98 Scouts and new Scouts from Westside Elementary meet on Monday nights at 6:30 pm.**

**New Scouts from McRae and Sidney Deener Elementary schools meet on Tuesday nights at 6:30 pm.**

Our calendar handout was printed with Monday dates. The Tuesday night group will only meet on weeks when the Monday group meets. For example, we are not meeting on Labor Day (a Monday), so we will not be meeting on the day after (which is Tuesday) either.

### Where do you meet?
Pack 98 meets at First Christian Church (our charter organization) at 2721 W Beebe Capps, Searcy, AR 72143.

Head west on Beebe-Capps past Harp's Grocery store, through the intersection; the building is on your left.

### Does our Scout need a uniform?
In an ideal world, all Scouts would have a uniform and want to wear it to all meetings. The uniform reinforces that all the boys are part of a single group working towards a common goal.

That being said, we will never exclude any Scout from participating in any Pack activity because of the lack of a uniform. We understand there are a number of reasons why
