**Welcome to Cub Scout Pack 98.** Our goal is to work with parents to develop our sons into people who care and understand about the amazing world around them. It’s been said that, **“Scouting is fun with a purpose”**, and we believe that to be true. Scouting does this by mixing fun activities like games, field trips, camping, competitions like Pinewood Derby, service projects, and crafts with teachings about character, citizenship, and concern for our fellow man.

Families are essential to our Pack success. Cub Scouts provides a structure for you and your son to play and learn together. You can do even more: every leader in Pack 98 either has a son in Scouting or was an Eagle Scout. **All of us are volunteers.** Please see one of us if you are interested in leading or helping out in any way.

## Meetings
### When do you meet?
Due to the surge in new Scouts joining us this year, we do not have enough space at the building for all of us to meet at one time. After much discussion, our solution is to split meetings into two nights a week:

**Returning Pack 98 Scouts and new Scouts from Westside Elementary meet on Monday nights at 6:30 pm.** [Calendar](calendar)

**New Scouts from McRae and Sidney Deener Elementary schools meet on Tuesday nights at 6:30 pm.** [Calendar](calendar)

Starting the week of September 11, Cub Scouts will meet Monday & Tuesday evenings at 6:30 pm at First Christian Church, 2721 W Beebe Capps.

Den meetings are held every Monday & Tuesday, except for the third Monday & Tuesday of the month when we hold our Pack Meeting.

Pack Committee meetings are every third Thursday of the month at 8:15 pm.

We follow the Searcy Public Schools inclement weather policy. If Searcy Public Schools are closed during the day, we will not meet that evening. 

### Where do you meet?
**Pack 98 meets at First Christian Church (our charter organization) at 2721 W Beebe Capps, Searcy, AR 72143.**

Head west on Beebe-Capps past Harp's Grocery store, through the intersection; the building is on your left.

## What is the Bobcat Badge?
All new Scouts must complete their Bobcat badge before working on their rank badge. Three of the Bobcat requirements are to learn the Cub Scout Motto, Scout Oath, and the Scout Law. Please work with your Scout to learn these before our first meeting. Here is [a complete set of the Bobcat requirements](bobcat.pdf).

## Cub Scout Motto
Do your best.

## Scout Oath
On my honor I will do my best to do my duty to God and my country and to obey the Scout Law; to help other people at all times; to keep myself physically strong, mentally awake, and morally straight.

## Scout Law
A Scout is trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean, and reverent.

## Youth Protection
All Scout leaders and Pack Committee members undergo Youth Protection Training every 2 years. **Reviewing the [Youth Protection: How to Protect Your Child from Child Abuse](http://www.scouting.org/filestore/pdf/100-014_WEB.pdf) guide with your Cub Scout is a requirement for every single rank, every year in Cub Scouts.**

## Can you explain Pack organization?
A Pack is a local Cub Scout unit divided up into Dens.

A Den is 5-10 boys in the same grade. Each Den works over the school year to complete the requirements for their rank badge. 

Grade | Rank 
----- | ----
1st Grade | Tiger
2nd Grade | Wolf
3rd Grade | Bear
4th Grade | Webelos I
5th Grade | Webelos II

## What is the Pack Committee and how is leadership organized?
The Pack Committee, headed by the Pack Committee Chairman, works with our charter organization, First Christian Church, to run our Cub Scout Pack.

The Pack Committee works with the Cubmaster and Den Leaders to provide a great program for our Cub Scouts.

Our Pack Committee's decision making is guided by three principles:
1. When possible, do what is best for the boys.
2. Don't punish boys for the mistakes of adults.
3. Financial transparency in all our efforts.

The Pack Committee consists of: John Exum (Pack Committee Chairman), Frank Likert (Treasurer & Assistant Cubmaster), Willie Abrams (Cubmaster), Bill LaGrange (Den Leader), and Jake Green (Assistant Den Leader). Scott Turley (Den Leader) is a member through the end of September 2017.
