**Welcome to Cub Scout Pack 98.** Our goal is to work with parents to develop our sons into people who care and understand about the amazing world around them. It’s been said that, **“Scouting is fun with a purpose”**, and we believe that to be true. Scouting does this by mixing fun activities like games, field trips, camping, competitions like Pinewood Derby, service projects, and crafts with teachings about character, citizenship, and concern for our fellow man.

Families are essential to our Pack success. Cub Scouts provides a structure for you and your son to play and learn together. You can do even more: every leader in Pack 98 either has a son in Scouting or was an Eagle Scout. **All of us are volunteers.** Please see one of us if you are interested in leading or helping out in any way.

## Meetings

## What is the Bobcat Badge?
All new Scouts must complete their Bobcat badge before working on their rank badge. Three of the Bobcat requirements are to learn the Cub Scout Motto, Scout Oath, and the Scout Law. Please work with your Scout to learn these before our first meeting. Here is [a complete set of the Bobcat requirements](bobcat.pdf).

## Cub Scout Motto
Do your best.

## Scout Oath
On my honor I will do my best to do my duty to God and my country and to obey the Scout Law; to help other people at all times; to keep myself physically strong, mentally awake, and morally straight.

## Scout Law
A Scout is trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean, and reverent.

## Youth Protection
All Scout leaders and Pack Committee members undergo Youth Protection Training every 2 years. **Reviewing the [Youth Protection: How to Protect Your Child from Child Abuse](http://www.scouting.org/filestore/pdf/100-014_WEB.pdf) guide with your Cub Scout is a requirement for every single rank, every year in Cub Scouts.**

## Can you explain Pack organization?
A Pack is a local Cub Scout unit divided up into Dens.

A Den is 5-10 Scouts in the same grade. Each Den works over the school year to complete the requirements for their rank badge. 

Grade | Rank 
----- | ----
1st Grade | Tiger
2nd Grade | Wolf
3rd Grade | Bear
4th Grade | Webelos I
5th Grade | Webelos II

## What is the Pack Committee?
The Pack Committee, headed by the Pack Committee Chairman, works with our charter organization, First Christian Church, to run our Cub Scout Pack.

The Pack Committee works with the Cubmaster and Den Leaders to provide a great program for our Cub Scouts.

Our Pack Committee's decision making is guided by three principles:
1. When possible, do what is best for the Scouts.
2. Don't punish boys for the mistakes of adults.
3. Financial transparency in all our efforts.
